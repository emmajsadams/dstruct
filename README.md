====

The missing typescript data structures and algorithms library. Based on Java & C# Collections, and Google Guava.

## Goals

* Use ES6 collections to implement for future proof performance, and minimum code size.
* Generic interfaces
* Error handling done with thrown exceptions for ease of use with try/catch. This is because with ES6 Harmony try/catch is a viable model for async error handling due to generators.

## Features

### Collections
* MultiSet
* BiMap

### Collection Interfaces
* List
* Map
* Iterator
* Set
* Comparator
* Collection

### Search Algorithms
* Binary Search
